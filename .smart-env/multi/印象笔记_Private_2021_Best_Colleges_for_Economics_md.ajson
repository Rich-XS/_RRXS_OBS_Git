Economics in America","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/harvard-university/","line":9},{"title":"**Alum:** The academics here are top-notch and extracurriculars are all-around excellent, as you would expect of a place with Harvard's reputation. If you are looking for a party school, this is not the place for you - the scene is pretty standard for a large-sized American school and on the whole you are expected to work hard more than play hard. Students spend a lot of time networking and treat their clubs like full-time careers, and for good reason - they often secure job offers on the strengths of having well-known student groups and internships on their resumes.\nHowever, the school still needs to work on doing more than paying lip service to diversity. It has exceptional cultural diversity but doesn't do enough for its students who are low-income and black or Native American, for instance. The school's mental health efforts have also been largely misdirected.\nRead 759 Reviews","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/harvard-university/","line":11},{"title":"A+","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/harvard-university/","line":15},{"title":"Overall Niche Grade","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/harvard-university/","line":16},{"title":"•","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/harvard-university/","line":17},{"title":"5% Acceptance Rate","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/harvard-university/","line":19},{"title":"•","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/harvard-university/","line":19},{"title":"$18,030 Net Price","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/harvard-university/","line":20},{"title":"•","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/harvard-university/","line":20},{"title":"1460-1570 SAT Range","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/harvard-university/","line":21},{"title":"./_resources/2021_Best_Colleges_for_Economics.resources/embedded.svg","target":"./_resources/2021_Best_Colleges_for_Economics.resources/embedded.svg","line":23},{"title":"Compare","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=harvard-university","line":23},{"title":"Will You Get In?","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/harvard-university/#scatterplot","line":23},{"title":"Yale University","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/yale-university/","line":26},{"title":"New Haven, CT •","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/yale-university/","line":28},{"title":"998 reviews","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/yale-university/","line":29},{"title":"#2 Best Colleges for Economics in America","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/yale-university/","line":30},{"title":"**Freshman:** Yale is an amazing school!

Claremont is a cool little village we walk to from campus and its only a short drive to beach or mountains.\nRead 395 Reviews","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/pomona-college/","line":431},{"title":"A+","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/pomona-college/","line":434},{"title":"Overall Niche Grade","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/pomona-college/","line":435},{"title":"•","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/pomona-college/","line":436},{"title":"7% Acceptance Rate","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/pomona-college/","line":437},{"title":"•","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/pomona-college/","line":437},{"title":"$18,500 Net Price","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/pomona-college/","line":438},{"title":"•","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/pomona-college/","line":438},{"title":"1390-1540 SAT Range","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/pomona-college/","line":439},{"title":"./_resources/2021_Best_Colleges_for_Economics.resources/embedded.11.svg","target":"./_resources/2021_Best_Colleges_for_Economics.resources/embedded.11.svg","line":441},{"title":"Compare","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=pomona-college","line":441},{"title":"Will You Get In?","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/pomona-college/#scatterplot","line":441},{"title":"University of Virginia","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-virginia/","line":444},{"title":"Charlottesville, VA •","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-virginia/","line":446},{"title":"2,240 reviews","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-virginia/","line":447},{"title":"#24 Best Colleges for Economics in America","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-virginia/","line":448},{"title":"**Sophomore:** UVA has been an amazing experience.

Classes can be difficult to find at first, but again, the community is very helpful with finding your way around grounds. The food is also great, and there's a nice selection in both the dining halls and the on-grounds restaurants! I'm incredibly happy I chose UVA.\nRead 2,240 Reviews","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-virginia/","line":450},{"title":"A+","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-virginia/","line":453},{"title":"Overall Niche Grade","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-virginia/","line":454},{"title":"•","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-virginia/","line":455},{"title":"24% Acceptance Rate","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-virginia/","line":456},{"title":"•","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-virginia/","line":456},{"title":"$17,579 Net Price","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-virginia/","line":457},{"title":"•","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-virginia/","line":457},{"title":"1340-1520 SAT Range","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-virginia/","line":458},{"title":"Compare","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=university-of-virginia","line":460},{"title":"Will You Get In?","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-virginia/#scatterplot","line":460},{"title":"William & Mary","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/william--and--mary/","line":462},{"title":"Williamsburg, VA •","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/william--and--mary/","line":464},{"title":"1,514 reviews","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/william--and--mary/","line":465},{"title":"#25 Best Colleges for Economics in America","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/william--and--mary/","line":466},{"title":"**Junior:** William & Mary is an amazing school, and I feel so lucky to be surrounded by so many wonderful peers, professors, and others who have made my experience so great. For people that don't want to go to very big school but also don't want to feel like everyone knows everyone, it's a great size. Additionally, it's a school with a very active student body that is both very caring and involved in trying to constantly better the W&M community. If you are someone who cares a lot about learning but also wants to make some amazing friends and live in an area with a lot of really interesting history, I definitely suggest looking into studying here! One of my favorite things about W&M is how many student groups, of all different types and sizes, exist on campus; I really do think that there's something for everyone. Furthermore, the vast majority of my professors have been fantastic and extremely dedicated to helping students succeed in their courses.\nRead 1,514 Reviews","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/william--and--mary/","line":468},{"title":"A+","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/william--and--mary/","line":471},{"title":"Overall Niche Grade","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/william--and--mary/","line":472},{"title":"•","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/william--and--mary/","line":473},{"title":"38% Acceptance Rate","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/william--and--mary/","line":474},{"title":"•","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/william--and--mary/","line":474},{"title":"$18,551 Net Price","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/william--and--mary/","line":475},{"title":"•","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/william--and--mary/","line":475},{"title":"1320-1510 SAT Range","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/william--and--mary/","line":476},{"title":"./_resources/2021_Best_Colleges_for_Economics.resources/embedded.12.svg","target":"./_resources/2021_Best_Colleges_for_Economics.resources/embedded.12.svg","line":478},{"title":"Compare","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=william--and--mary","line":478},{"title":"Will You Get In?","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/william--and--mary/#scatterplot","line":478},{"title":"Sponsored\n\t\n\t## Trinity College - Connecticut\n\t\n\t* 4 Year •","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/trinity-college---connecticut/","line":481},{"title":"Hartford, CT •","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/trinity-college---connecticut/","line":487},{"title":"728 reviews","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/trinity-college---connecticut/","line":488},{"title":"**Sophomore:** Trinity College is a wonderful university that strives to help its students to become the best achievers they can be!

It has exceptional cultural diversity but doesn't do enough for its students who are low-income and black or Native American, for instance.

Areas for improvement at the school include making significant improvements to residential life and updating older dorms and academic buildings.\nRead 738 Reviews","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/augustana-college---illinois/","line":518},{"title":"B+","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/augustana-college---illinois/","line":523},{"title":"Overall Niche Grade","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/augustana-college---illinois/","line":524},{"title":"•","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/augustana-college---illinois/","line":525},{"title":"57% Acceptance Rate","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/augustana-college---illinois/","line":526},{"title":"•","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/augustana-college---illinois/","line":526},{"title":"$24,706 Net Price","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/augustana-college---illinois/","line":527},{"title":"./_resources/2021_Best_Colleges_for_Economics.resources/embedded.14.svg","target":"./_resources/2021_Best_Colleges_for_Economics.resources/embedded.14.svg","line":529},{"title":"Will You Get In?","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/augustana-college---illinois/#scatterplot","line":529},{"title":"Compare","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/compare/?type=college&colleges=augustana-college---illinois","line":529},{"title":"Sponsored\n\t\n\t## Grinnell College\n\t\n\t* 4 Year •","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/grinnell-college/","line":532},{"title":"Grinnell, IA •","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/grinnell-college/","line":538},{"title":"421 reviews","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/grinnell-college/","line":539},{"title":"**Freshman:** Grinnell has a whole has been an incredible experience so far.

would expect of a place with Harvard's reputation. If you are looking for a party school, this is not the place for you - the scene is pretty standard for a large-sized American school and on the whole you are expected to work hard more than play hard. Students spend a lot of time networking and treat their clubs like full-time careers, and for good reason - they often secure job offers on the strengths of having well-known student groups and internships on their resumes.\nHowever, the school still needs to work on doing more than paying lip service to diversity. It has exceptional cultural diversity but doesn't do enough for its students who are low-income and black or Native American, for instance.

encouraged to debate, rethink, and most importantly, listen. I was able to take a graduate student course as a first-year, and was amazed by the level of respectful and intellectual discussion that was possible! Students and professors alike are motivated, caring, and inclusive, and there's a strong sense of community everywhere you go, from the UCPD officer on the street corner to the dining hall staff. There's truly something for everyone, from Student Action to University Theater to Circus Club to Greek life.

encouraged to debate, rethink, and most importantly, listen. I was able to take a graduate student course as a first-year, and was amazed by the level of respectful and intellectual discussion that was possible! Students and professors alike are motivated, caring, and inclusive, and there's a strong sense of community everywhere you go, from the UCPD officer on the street corner to the dining hall staff. There's truly something for everyone, from Student Action to University Theater to Circus Club to Greek life.

students. Many of Duke's majors/minors are flexible and easy to combine, so I was able to study what truly interested me while still getting a well-rounded education. The strong level of professor engagement also sets Duke apart; I became close with many of my professors who served as mentors, advisors, and friends throughout college and even now after graduation. It's easy to get involved with research, study abroad, or engage in other opportunities that interest you. Duke has a diverse social scene, so there really is a place for everyone, but it can be challenging to navigate the selective organizations. There are hundreds of student groups to join, and most have strong social components too. The food and campus living environment are both superb, and the city of Durham is nearby and nice as well.

students. Many of Duke's majors/minors are flexible and easy to combine, so I was able to study what truly interested me while still getting a well-rounded education. The strong level of professor engagement also sets Duke apart; I became close with many of my professors who served as mentors, advisors, and friends throughout college and even now after graduation. It's easy to get involved with research, study abroad, or engage in other opportunities that interest you. Duke has a diverse social scene, so there really is a place for everyone, but it can be challenging to navigate the selective organizations. There are hundreds of student groups to join, and most have strong social components too. The food and campus living environment are both superb, and the city of Durham is nearby and nice as well.

There is truly a culture throughout the university of caring about the students and doing everything possible to help them succeed. The academics are, of course, extremely challenging, but there are plenty of ways to get help and the academic faculty are always very receptive to students needing assistance. Most everyone has the drive to succeed without creating an overly competitive or cutthroat environment.

No shortage of ways to get involved on campus socially. You will be surrounded by warm, intellectual, and hard-working peers. Weather can be unpleasant for those used to warmer climates. Career resources could be better, and students approach job fairs in a somewhat cut-throat manner. I have heard that the same is true for certain undergraduate majors/pre-professional tracks, such as pre-med and engineering. Overall, a memorable and wonderful place to go to school as an undergrad-- Ithaca is gorges!

No shortage of ways to get involved on campus socially. You will be surrounded by warm, intellectual, and hard-working peers. Weather can be unpleasant for those used to warmer climates. Career resources could be better, and students approach job fairs in a somewhat cut-throat manner. I have heard that the same is true for certain undergraduate majors/pre-professional tracks, such as pre-med and engineering. Overall, a memorable and wonderful place to go to school as an undergrad-- Ithaca is gorges!

wasn't even aware I was interested in! The unique open curriculum allows students to take courses from a broad range of subjects and helps to ensure they find the right area of study. I personally believed I wanted to go into biomedical engineering, however, after taking a variety of classes at Brown in environmental studies, I have switched my major.

wasn't even aware I was interested in! The unique open curriculum allows students to take courses from a broad range of subjects and helps to ensure they find the right area of study. I personally believed I wanted to go into biomedical engineering, however, after taking a variety of classes at Brown in environmental studies, I have switched my major.

The mix of academics, clubs and outdoor activities, and social scene is (in my opinion) unparalleled. Everyone is academically driven, and I feel like I can have an intellectual conversation with anyone on campus. There is a sport, club, or outdoor activity for everyone at the college, as most people I know are heavily involved in at least 2 extracurricular clubs. Lastly, the social scene is fun and inclusive. There are different frats and sororities for different all types of preferences, and every house has an \"open door\" policy. There is little to no social hierarchy that I've noticed (Football players aren't treated differently from comp sci geeks), making it so that anyone can be friends with anyone.\nOne additional note: sophomore summer is the best term of all time!

America","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/dartmouth-college/","line":1},{"title":"**Junior:** It is hard to imagine a better college than Dartmouth. The mix of academics, clubs and outdoor activities, and social scene is (in my opinion) unparalleled. Everyone is academically driven, and I feel like I can have an intellectual conversation with anyone on campus. There is a sport, club, or outdoor activity for everyone at the college, as most people I know are heavily involved in at least 2 extracurricular clubs. Lastly, the social scene is fun and inclusive. There are different frats and sororities for different all types of preferences, and every house has an \"open door\" policy. There is little to no social hierarchy that I've noticed (Football players aren't treated differently from comp sci geeks), making it so that anyone can be friends with anyone.\nOne additional note: sophomore summer is the best term of all time!

Notre Dame was my professors! They have all been willing to go the extra mile in order to teach, be it holding long office hours and staying later or staying back long after class has ended, especially before exams. Their passion not only for the subject but for our education really helped me through some tough courses. Furthermore, the community is excellent. Notre Dame is truly a family, and dorm communities are very distinct and strong. Each dorm has its own mascots and colors and become a part of a person's identity. It is similar to Greek life but without the negatives of rushing and hazing.

Economics in America","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-notre-dame/","line":1},{"title":"**Freshman:** The thing that stood out to me about the University of Notre Dame was my professors! They have all been willing to go the extra mile in order to teach, be it holding long office hours and staying later or staying back long after class has ended, especially before exams. Their passion not only for the subject but for our education really helped me through some tough courses. Furthermore, the community is excellent. Notre Dame is truly a family, and dorm communities are very distinct and strong. Each dorm has its own mascots and colors and become a part of a person's identity. It is similar to Greek life but without the negatives of rushing and hazing.

This school is by no means perfect, like all other colleges there are plenty of flaws, but it is truly one of the best options for an undergrad university that you could choose. Despite what rumors may have indicated, most of the students are incredibly friendly, academics are superb, the town of Lexington is adorable, extracurriculars are treasured by nearly every student. Unlike some of the schools I have previously attended, W&L is an incredibly close-knit community full of passionate and hardworking students. It is considered \"cool\" to be smart, and students at W&L work and play hard. Also, If you are considering playing a sport here- DO IT! As a student athlete I have had an incredibly valuable experience and the woman on my team will likely be close friends for the rest of my life.

Colleges for Economics in America","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/washington--and--lee-university/","line":1},{"title":"**Junior:** I know it's been a hot topic recently, but I would like to set the record straight. This school is by no means perfect, like all other colleges there are plenty of flaws, but it is truly one of the best options for an undergrad university that you could choose. Despite what rumors may have indicated, most of the students are incredibly friendly, academics are superb, the town of Lexington is adorable, extracurriculars are treasured by nearly every student. Unlike some of the schools I have previously attended, W&L is an incredibly close-knit community full of passionate and hardworking students. It is considered \"cool\" to be smart, and students at W&L work and play hard. Also, If you are considering playing a sport here- DO IT! As a student athlete I have had an incredibly valuable experience and the woman on my team will likely be close friends for the rest of my life. I simply love this school- of course it is not perfect, but no school is.\nRead 439 Reviews","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/washington--and--lee-university/","line":3},{"title":"A+","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/washington--and--lee-university/","line":6},{"title":"Overall Niche Grade","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/washington--and--lee-university/","line":7},{"title":"•","target":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/washington--and--lee-university/","line":8}],"class_name":"SmartBlock"},

That can make it extremely easy to meet people in an intellectual sense but somewhat difficult to meet in a social sense.

The campus is beautiful and the academics are stellar. The whole school feels like one big family. The athletic programs are top notch and really bring all the students together. I love being able to attend countless games while seeing cheering fans who truly love where they go to school. The best part about the University of Southern California is the Trojan alumni. With over 425,000 Trojan alumni in the world, you are always connected to a Trojan. The wonderful Trojan alumni are there for you beyond your four years. They give opportunities to advance in your desired career field, as well as be there in a new environment. No other university is this connected between current students and alumni.

is like no other. The campus is beautiful and the academics are stellar. The whole school feels like one big family. The athletic programs are top notch and really bring all the students together. I love being able to attend countless games while seeing cheering fans who truly love where they go to school. The best part about the University of Southern California is the Trojan alumni. With over 425,000 Trojan alumni in the world, you are always connected to a Trojan. The wonderful Trojan alumni are there for you beyond your four years. They give opportunities to advance in your desired career field, as well as be there in a new environment. No other university is this connected between current students and alumni.

It's a very diverse group of students, and because there are 4 other colleges there, we have access to a wide range of classes, locations and experiences across the \"5C's.\" I play softball for Pomona Pitzer, and the team spirit keeps me sane, while the support from other student-athletes from football and baseball, etc. is really cool. It's a small school, but big on ideas and things to do in and around LA area.

It's a very diverse group of students, and because there are 4 other colleges there, we have access to a wide range of classes, locations and experiences across the \"5C's.\" I play softball for Pomona Pitzer, and the team spirit keeps me sane, while the support from other student-athletes from football and baseball, etc. is really cool. It's a small school, but big on ideas and things to do in and around LA area.

The dorms are incredibly well maintained, and the sense of community is fantastic. Everyone I've spoken to has been so nice and helpful! Classes can be difficult to find at first, but again, the community is very helpful with finding your way around grounds. The food is also great, and there's a nice selection in both the dining halls and the on-grounds restaurants!

The dorms are incredibly well maintained, and the sense of community is fantastic. Everyone I've spoken to has been so nice and helpful! Classes can be difficult to find at first, but again, the community is very helpful with finding your way around grounds. The food is also great, and there's a nice selection in both the dining halls and the on-grounds restaurants!

peers, professors, and others who have made my experience so great. For people that don't want to go to very big school but also don't want to feel like everyone knows everyone, it's a great size. Additionally, it's a school with a very active student body that is both very caring and involved in trying to constantly better the W&M community. If you are someone who cares a lot about learning but also wants to make some amazing friends and live in an area with a lot of really interesting history, I definitely suggest looking into studying here! One of my favorite things about W&M is how many student groups, of all different types and sizes, exist on campus; I really do think that there's something for everyone.

peers, professors, and others who have made my experience so great. For people that don't want to go to very big school but also don't want to feel like everyone knows everyone, it's a great size. Additionally, it's a school with a very active student body that is both very caring and involved in trying to constantly better the W&M community. If you are someone who cares a lot about learning but also wants to make some amazing friends and live in an area with a lot of really interesting history, I definitely suggest looking into studying here! One of my favorite things about W&M is how many student groups, of all different types and sizes, exist on campus; I really do think that there's something for everyone.

The staff care deeply about your well-being and want you to succeed. The smaller class sizes allow for greater interaction between students and professors for deeper understanding of course content. Additionally, a smaller school allows you to get more involved in campus activities and programs, along with meet more people.\nThe campus ministries was welcoming, and my faith life was also enhanced greatly through personal relationships with the pastors and getting to know other students on retreats.\nFinding employment on campus was easy, and working in Admissions was a terrific experience!
